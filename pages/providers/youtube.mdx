Click Manage Third Party App Access

Put your Client ID for the app you created in previous steps into the search box and select your app

### Step 4 Set scopes and Google Data Access for the app to Trusted
Once set, click save

### Step 5 Wait at least 5 hours for the changes to propegate.
After this time you should now be able to add your Youtube channel to your Postiz account
