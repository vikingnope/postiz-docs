Fill in all the details, once created head over to Products and make sure you add all the required products.

It is important to request the Advertising API permissions and fill up the request form, or you will not have the ability to refresh your tokens.

<OAuth2Redirect provider = "linkedin" />

If you are using the "LinkedIN Page" provider, then the redirect url should be "linkedin-page".

Copy the created `Client ID` and `Client Secret` and add them to your `.env` file.

```env
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_ID=""
LINKEDIN_CLIENT_SECRET=""
```
You can find those under the Auth Tab of your LinkedIn App in the developer portal.
