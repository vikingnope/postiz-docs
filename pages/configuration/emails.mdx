Postiz supports two email providers: Resend and NodeMailer (SMTP).

If you have an email provider configured, then new users will require activation.

```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER: "resend|nodemailer"
```

You can set the sender name and email address for all providers as follows;

```env
EMAIL_FROM_NAME: "Postiz Emailer"
EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS: "postiz@example.com"
```

## Resend

Postiz uses Resend to send email notifications to users. If this key is set, users
will also require activation.

* Register to [Resend](https://resend.com), and connect your domain.
* Copy your API Key from the Resend control panel.
* Open the .env file and edit the following line.

```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER="resend"
RESEND_API_KEY="<your-api-key-here>"
```

## NodeMailer (SMTP)

This is an alternative to Resend. You can use NodeMailer, which is simply a SMTP library, to connect to any SMTP server.

```env
EMAIL_PROVIDER: "nodemailer"
EMAIL_HOST: "smtp.gmail.com" # smtp host if you choose nodemailer
EMAIL_PORT: "465" # smtp port if you choose nodemailer
EMAIL_SECURE: "true" # smtp secure if you choose nodemailer
EMAIL_USER: "user" # smtp user if you choose nodemailer
EMAIL_PASS: "pass" # smtp pass if you choose nodemailer
```
